## Project Overview

### Project Title
**CloudCraft**

### Project Brief
I will be developing a full-stack interview question bank application for interviewers at AWS. This app will allow users to access technical and situational interview questions that can be filtered by role, level, and question type. The questions will be stored in an AWS DynamoDB table, and the deployed resources will interact with the database to display the questions on the frontend.

I will design, build, and deploy the entire application using AWS cloud services and CI/CD pipelines. The backend will be serverless, with Lambda functions written in Python to handle requests via API Gateway. The infrastructure will be defined using AWS CDK in TypeScript, allowing me to manage all resources—Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch—as code. The application will be deployed using GitHub Actions, with the source code stored in GitHub and version-controlled using Git.

I will also develop the frontend using Cloudscape, built on the React framework. The frontend will communicate with the backend through API Gateway and will be accessible only to authenticated users via AWS Cognito. I will configure Cognito for user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access. To monitor and maintain performance, I will use AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail, setting up dashboards to visualize metrics, logs, and activity for my Lambda resource.

### Project Timeline
